## Architecture
This section describes the main components of the plugin and how they interface.

### Block Diagram
![BACnet Plugin Block Diagram](assets/bacnet_blockdiagram.png)

The BACnet Plugin exposes several new protocol specific abilities to your Caldera instance. The abilities are executed from a host running a Caldera agent via the corresponding payload. Abilities must target devices that support the BACnet protocol to achieve the described effects.

### Payloads

The BACnet plugin leverages several payloads that are part of the BACnet Stack detailed in the [libraries](#libraries) section. Each payload is an individual BACnet service, with a name combining `bac` + `service_name`. The payloads have been compiled for 2 different architectures.

Example payloads for BACnet Read Property service:
* `bacrp.exe` - Windows executable **Read Property** protocol service
* `bacrp` - Linux executable for the **Read Property** protocol service

#### Compatibility
The plugin's payloads currently support deployment to Caldera Agents of the following computer architectures:

|        | Windows | Linux | Macintosh |
| -----: | :-----: | :---: | :-------: |
| 32-bit |         |       |           |
| 64-bit | **X**   | **X** |           |

* The Linux payload was compiled on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS with GNU Make 4.4.
* The Windows payload was compiled on Windows 10 v21H2 with GNU Make 4.4.1 (part of Mingw64 tools downloaded through MSYS2).


### Libraries
The following libraries were used to build the BACnet payloads:

| Library | Version	 | License |
|---------|--------- |---------|
|bacnet-stack |[1.0](https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack/tree/bacnet-stack-1.0) |[GPL](https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack/tree/master/license)      |

## Usage
This section describes how to initially deploy and execute the abilities present within the BACnet plugin.

### Deployment
1. Identify the target system you would like to communicate with via the BACnet protocol.
2. Identify a viable host for the Caldera agent that will be sending BACnet
   messages to the target system. A viable host will have a network connect to the target
   system and be [compatible](#compatibility) with the payloads in this plugin.
3. Deploy the Caldera agent to the viable host.
4. Run a combination of the BACnet plugin abilities to achieve the desired effect. 

_If you don't know where to begin, try using [Who-Is](#who-is) to discover BACnet devices on the network._

```{tip}
Reference the Caldera training plugin for a step-by-step tutorial on how to deploy an agent and run abilities via an operation.
```

### Abilities

#### Who-Is
The Who-Is service is used by a sending BACnet-user to determine the Device
object identifier, the network address, or both, of other BACnet devices that
share the same internetwork.

__Ability Command:__
```caldera
./bacwi
```

#### Who-Has
The Who-Has service is used by a sending BACnet-user to determine the Device
object identifier, the network address, or both, of BACnet devices that contain
a given object name or object identifier.


If a device in the instance range has that object, an "I-Have" response will be
reported, stating the object-type and object-instance

__Ability Command:__
```caldera
./bacwh #{bacnet.device.min_instance} #{bacnet.device.max_instance} #{bacnet.obj.name}
```
__Facts:__  
| Name | Description | Type |
|:-----|:------------|:----:|
| `bacnet.device.min_instance` | Minimum device instance to check | int |
| `bacnet.device.max_instance` | Maximum device instance to check | int |
| `bacnet.obj.name` | object-name, object-type, or object-instance to check for | string |


__Examples:__  
```sh
./bacwh 100200 100300 "Timer"
````
```sh
./bacwh 100200 100300 binary-value 7
```

#### EPICS Report
Generates an EPICS report - which provides services supported, the object list,
and properties of those objects.

__Ability Command:__
```caldera
./bacepics #{bacnet.device.instance}
```

__Facts:__

./bacepics 100101
```

#### Get Event Information
The GetEventInformation service is used by a client BACnet-user to get a summary
of all active state events on the target device.

__Ability Command:__
```caldera
./bacge #{bacnet.device.instance}
```

__Facts:__  
| Name | Description | Type |
|:-----|:------------|:----:|
| `bacnet.device.instance` | Device instance to poll (also accepts IP:Port address of device) | int |

__Examples:__  
```sh
./bacge 100101

#### Read Property
The ReadProperty service is used by a client BACnet-user to request the value of
one property of one BACnet Object.

__Ability Command:__
```caldera
./bacrp #{bacnet.device.instance} #{bacnet.obj.type} #{bacnet.obj.instance} #{bacnet.obj.property} #{bacnet.read.index}
```

| `bacnet.read.index` | How to handle reading arrays | int |

Read Index Values:
- `-2`: An improved -1 for arrays. Iteratively reads each index of the array-type property
- `-1`: Reads the whole property (this can fail for arrays if the device doesn't support segmentation)
- `0`: Gets the length of the property if it is an array type
- `1..N`: Gets the property value at index N if it is an array type

__Examples:__  
Read the PRESENT VALUE (property 85) of instance 7 of the ANALOG INPUTS (object
type 0) on device instance 100101. Read the full property (read index -2).
```sh
./bacrp 100101 0 7 85 -2
```

Read the OBJECT LIST (property 76) of instance 100101 of the DEVICES (object
type 8) on device instance 100101. Read the full property (read index -2).

values of one or more specified properties of one ore more BACnet Objects. For
example, a single property for a single object, a list of properties for a
single object, or even any number of properties for any number of objects.

Read Property Multiple is similar to Read Property, but allows multiple
properties to be provided, in the form of a comma separated list (e.g., "1,2,3").

| `bacnet.write.tag` | The [type of value](#bacnet-fact-values) to be written | int or string |
| `bacnet.write.value` | The write value itself | string |

The value (`#{bacnet.write.value}`) is an ASCII representation of some type of
data that you wish to write.  It is encoded using the tag information provided
(`#{bacnet.write.tag}`). For example, if you were writing a REAL value of
100.0, you would use a `#{bacnet.write.value}` of `'100.0'` and a 
`#{bacnet.write.tag}` of `4`.

__Examples:__  

Write a BOOLEAN value of FALSE to property 85 (PRESENT_VALUE) of instance 7 of
object 4 (BINARY_OUTPUT) on device instance 100101. Write the full property with 
a precedence of 5.
```sh
./bacwp 100101 4 7 85 5 -1 1 0

## Protocol Details

BACnet models a device as a collection of **objects**. Each object represents
something on the device: a sensor, an output, a schedule, the device itself, etc.

### Objects

An object is identified by its **object type** plus an **object instance**:

- **Object type**: the kind of thing it is  
  Examples: `analog-input`, `analog-output`, `binary-input`, `device`, `schedule`, etc.  
  For a list of object types see the [BACnet Fact Values](#bacnet-fact-values) section.

- **Object instance**: which one of that type it is  
  Each object type on a device has instance numbers (0, 1, 2, …) that uniquely
  identify individual objects of that type on that device. Note that the object
  instance is always an integer value.

Together, `(object type, object instance)` uniquely identify an object within a device.

### Properties

Each object has **properties**, which are named pieces of data that describe the
object or its current state. For example:

- `object-identifier` – the object’s type and instance
- `object-name` – a human-readable label
- `present-value` – the current value (e.g., temperature, setpoint)
- `units` – engineering units (e.g., degrees Celsius)
- `status-flags` – alarm/fault/overridden indicators

For a list of property types see the [BACnet Fact Values](#bacnet-fact-values) section.

Some property values are stored as arrays. In these cases, the `#{bacnet.read.index}` or `#{bacnet.write.index}`
facts are used to identify the **index** in that array to read or write.

### BACnet Fact Values

As described above, uniquely specifying a data object in BACnet requires specifying:
- the Object Type
- the Instance of that Object
- the Property within that Object
- and, if the property contains an array, the Index within the Property

Additionally, for a [Write Property](#write-property) operation, a *write tag*
(`#{bacnet.write.tag}`) must be supplied to indicate how to interpret the value
passed to the ability (`#{bacnet.write.value}`).

The object instance (`#{bacnet.obj.instance}`) is always an integer. The other
facts can be provided either as a numeric code or as a string. The numeric codes
are defined by the BACnet specification and are consistent across BACnet
implementations. BACnet Stack (the library underlying this plugin) also defines
human-readable string equivalents for these codes, which may be more convenient
in many cases.

You can find the full list of codes and their string equivalents in the BACnet
Stack source code:
